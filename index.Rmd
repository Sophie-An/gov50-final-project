## Project thoughts

I'd love to use data about the effects of environmental policy on behavior by comparing some metric before and after a change in policy. There isn't a specific policy I'm thinking about yet. I also may use EPA data. Alternatively, I'd like to compare the effects of different incentives (immediate cash, future benefit, laws/mandates) in the environmental realm.
